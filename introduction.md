# cardano-api

Building and submitting transactions to the cardano blockchain is usually done with a high level of abstraction, using the [plutus contract monad](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/tree/main/plutus-contract)or the CTL (cardano transaction library) contract monad to construct, balance, and submit transactions.

another tool to build and submit transactions is the `cardano-cli`. the cardano-cli comes with the cardano-node and uses the cardano-api library unter the hood. the following examples, taken from the third iteration of the [plutus pioneer program](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program/tree/third-iteration), will try to show how the `cardano-cli` makes use of the `cardano-api` to build, balance, sign and transmit transactions. 

sometimes it may also be necessary to use the cardano-api directly. One example for this is the [mlabs hydra-demo](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/hydra-demo). The interface to speak to a hydra node is a websocket and so tools like the PAB are not available. `examples/hydra-demo.md` shows how the cardano-api can be used to build, balance and sign transactions (which then are serialised to `CBOR` and transmitted through websocket to a hydra node).
